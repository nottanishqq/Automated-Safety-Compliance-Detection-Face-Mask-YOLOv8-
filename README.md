# Object-detection-from-scratch
**Overview**

This project implements an object detector from scratch using basic machine learning principles to differentiate between facial images of masked and unmasked individuals. It's designed to provide a foundational understanding of object detection without relying on complex, pre-built frameworks.

**Features**

- Masked vs. Unmasked Detection: Identifies whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not.

- From Scratch Implementation: Built using fundamental libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, and OpenCV for core operations, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of object detection.

- Simple Data Handling: Demonstrates how to load, preprocess, and prepare image data for a custom object detection model.

- Training and Evaluation: Includes the necessary steps to train the model and evaluate its performance.
